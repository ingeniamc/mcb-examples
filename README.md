# MCB library Examples

## Highlights ####

Set of examples that manage different features of the MCB library, each example makes the focus on one feature.
The examples are sorted and it's extremely recommended to follow them in order.
* Examples with [STM32F407VGT](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f407vg.html) devices
* Developed with [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-ides/stm32cubeide.html) and the GNU compiler from ST
* Compiled using C language

## Examples

1. **mcb-master-config**: Sets up the MCB environment and uses the config messages.
2. **mcb-master-cyclic**: Changes the MCB state to the cyclic mode and uses the mapping arrays.
3. **mcb-master-coc**: Changes the MCB state to the cyclic mode and uses the Config Over Cyclic option and cyclic data transfer simultaneously.
